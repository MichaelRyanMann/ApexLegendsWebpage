# ApexLegendsWebpage
my attempt to recreate a page from apex legends website

this is one of my first real attepmts to start practicing my responsive css skills. i built this from scratch by pretty much
just looking at their page and then somewhat forcing myself to just try to recreate the design the best i could without inspecting 
their page. i wanted to practice trying to create from a basic guide without necessarily pulling bits and pieces from
other projects or examples. it is 100% not perfect, probably some mistakes in their, and their are probably better ways to do what
i did, but i feel like i learned quite a bit. i learned i need to get some more practice with positioning elements, id like to get
better creating responive nav bars, i need some more practice with nested flex objects, and overall just cleaning and drying my css 
skills up. overall this was a pretty cool project for me becuase i feel like i often start little things, but it is cool to see a 
page that looks visually decently complete. i still have stuff to do though so it isnt fully complete. i need to add hyperlink 
functionality, add social media images to link to pages, and lastly and most importantly create the other html page and js that 
will populate the markup with the specific legends individual information.
